This is the code for Project 4 from Pedram Sadeghian's CMSC132 Spring 2022 course. This was all developed to run in Eclipse IDE.

It is a calculator application where you can calculate what the simple interest, compound interest, or both will be over the span
of up to 25 years. It was created using JaxaFX.

All of the code in Interest.java and InterestTableGUI.java was written by me.
