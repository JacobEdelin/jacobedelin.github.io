This is the code for Project 7 from Nelson Padua-Perez's CMSC131 Fall 2021 course. This was all developed to run in
Eclipse IDE.
All of the code in DrawingApp.java, CombineLeftRight.java, CombineTopBottom.java, Flag.java, HorizontalBars.java,
TwoDimArrayUtil.java, VerticalBars.java, and StudentTests.java was developed by me unless stated otherwise.
