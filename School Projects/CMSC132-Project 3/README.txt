This is the code for Project 3 from Pedram Sadeghian's CMSC132 Spring 2022 course. This was all developed to run in Eclipse IDE.

It is a game where you have to clear away blocks before they reach the bottom (like a reverse Tetris).

All of the code in ClearCellGame.java and Game.java was written by me unless stated otherwise.
